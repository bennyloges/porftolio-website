                        <h2>Objective</h2>
                        <p>Address the <strong>decline</strong> in R&D project <strong>flagging rates</strong> and boost engagement by creating an <span>accessible</span> and <span>informative</span> resource platform.</p>
                        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                        <p>Project teams across the business have expressed <strong>difficulty</strong> in comprehending <strong>how</strong> the incentive scheme applies to their work, leading to a <strong>lack of resonance</strong> and <strong>decreased engagement</strong>. This challenge stems from the absence of easily accessible resources related to qualified projects that may pertain to their work, or guidance on what types of work are eligible for the incentive.</p>
                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                        <p>Our challenge is to <strong>increase engagement</strong> and encourage the flagging of R&D projects within the organization.</p>
                        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
                        <p>We hypothesize that creating an intranet site dedicated to qualified projects, organized by key themes (e.g., sustainability) or discipline, will provide project teams with accessible and relatable examples. This will lead to greater understanding and increased engagement.</p>
                        <h2>Scope</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create an intuitive and user-friendly intranet site.</li>
                            <li>Organize qualified projects by themes and disciplines.</li>
                            <li>Provide easy access to relevant resources.</li>
                            <li>Promote understanding of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme.</li>
                            <li>Implement user feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Desired Outcomes</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Increase in Flagged Projects:</strong> The primary goal is to see a significant rise in the number of R&D projects flagged for review within the organization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Increased Contact Form Submissions:</strong> We aim to encourage more project teams to complete contact forms, signaling their interest in exploring the R&D Tax Incentive scheme for their projects.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2>Approach</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Conduct <strong>user research</strong> to understand the specific needs and pain points of project teams.</li>
                            <li>Develop an intranet site <strong>prototype</strong> with a focus on user experience.</li>
                            <li>Populate the site with content organized around themes and disciplines.</li>
                            <li>Promote the site and its resources within the organization.</li>
                            <li>Monitor engagement and gather <strong>feedback</strong> for <strong>improvement.</strong></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>By addressing the challenge of low engagement and improving understanding of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme, this project aims to facilitate <strong>increased project flagging</strong> and <strong>promote</strong> innovation across the business.</p>

                    <p>Many New Zealanders are unsure of how they're spending their money, even though most have a budget, often just in their minds. However, there hasn't been a tool that Kiwi users have found truly effective in assisting them to manage their finances and achieve their goals.</p>
                    <p>These tools tend to be either overly complicated, require too much manual effort, or fail to offer the necessary meaningful insights that users require.</p>

                <p>“We believe by providing a platform for Kiwi's with low financial wellbeing a digital wallet that enables them to easily manage their finances and track their spending, our users will develop healthier financial behaviours that strengthen their financial wellbeing and achieve their short-long term financial goals.”</p>
                <h3>User Personas</h3>
                <p>Based on thorough user research, I created personas reflecting real users' diverse traits and needs. These personas guided my design decisions, ensuring a user-centered project.</p>

                    <p>Right now, budgeting tools treat goal setting and financial planning as two independent matters. This makes it hard for users to:</p>

                        <li>See where their money currently goes</li>

                <p>Throughout this journey, I've learned that user insights are the compass guiding every design decision. The integration of budgeting and goal setting resonated strongly with users, enhancing their financial management experience.</p>
                <p>If I were to tackle this again, I'd involve users even earlier in the process to ensure their needs are deeply embedded from the start. Additionally, refining the educational aspect to bridge the gap between understanding spending and goal achievement would be a priority. Overall, this experience reaffirmed the transformative power of putting users at the heart of design.</p>
